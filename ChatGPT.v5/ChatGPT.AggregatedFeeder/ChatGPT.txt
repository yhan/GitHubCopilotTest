Got it — you want a single “aggregated feeder” that ingests several market data feeds, normalizes them, and publishes one consolidated stream (e.g., NBBO quotes + consolidated trades). Here’s a lean but solid .NET 8 example you can run today. It shows:

pluggable adapters (IMarketDataFeed)

symbol normalization

per-venue state with staleness handling

NBBO computation (best bid = max, best ask = min) with tie-breakers

optional conflation

a unified async stream clients can consume

You can drop real adapters (FIX/WebSocket/etc.) in later — two simulated venues are provided so it runs out of the box.


Notes & next steps

Adapters: implement IMarketDataFeed for real sources (FIX/FAST, ITCH, WebSocket APIs). Map per-venue symbols ? canonical tickers before emitting.

Order book (L2): add a BookDelta type and a price-level map per venue; compute merged book via price-time priority or venue weighting.

Clocking: consider PTP/NTP sync; prefer exchange?provided event timestamps; record both event and receive time (already modeled).

Crossed/locked handling: above we just flag it. In production you may filter, widen, or apply a venue-priority policy.

Conflation: the minNbboEmitInterval is a simple guard; add “emit on change OR every N ms” policies per downstream SLA.

Health: treat missing heartbeats as stale; publish feed-status events.

Distribution: expose the aggregated stream via gRPC, WebSocket, or shared memory ring buffer; the Channel<AggEvent> makes this trivial to surface.

If you want this in Java (Project Loom + Flow/Reactive Streams) or with a Redis/Kafka egress, say the word and I’ll drop that version too.

je lui demande pourquoi Channel ?

Good eye — that snippet is configuring the channel (the in-memory async queue) that carries aggregated events (AggEvent) to consumers.

Let’s break it down:

private readonly Channel<AggEvent> _out = Channel.CreateUnbounded<AggEvent>(
    new UnboundedChannelOptions
    {
        SingleReader = true,
        SingleWriter = false
    });

1. Channel<T>

From System.Threading.Channels.

Think of it as an async, thread-safe producer/consumer queue.

Writers call Writer.WriteAsync / TryWrite.

Readers call Reader.ReadAsync / WaitToReadAsync.

2. CreateUnbounded

“Unbounded” means no fixed capacity; it can buffer arbitrarily many AggEvents until the consumer drains them.

Use this when you don’t want backpressure (risk: if consumer stalls, memory can balloon).

3. UnboundedChannelOptions

These hints let the runtime optimize locking:

SingleReader = true
? Only one consumer will ever read from _out.Reader.
Benefit: the channel can skip some locks/contention on read side.

SingleWriter = false
? Multiple concurrent producers may write into the channel.
That matches the aggregator design: several tasks (one per feed adapter) plus the main aggregator loop can all emit downstream.

If you set both SingleReader = true and SingleWriter = true, the channel chooses the most optimized internal implementation (basically a lock-free queue specialized for single-writer/single-reader).

? So in plain terms:
That line builds an async queue with unlimited buffer, many writers allowed, but guaranteed only one reader. It’s a performance/throughput choice — it avoids locking on the consumer side while still allowing multiple concurrent producers.

Do you want me to also show what would change if we set SingleWriter = true (i.e., aggregator is the only producer) — and how that would slightly improve throughput but restrict your design?

Why would you code a egress ? 

ChatGPT

Great question. In the code I gave you, the aggregated feeder is like the core of a market data system: it ingests feeds, merges them, and produces a normalized view (e.g. NBBO).

But it doesn’t end there. In a real system, you need a way to deliver (egress) that aggregated stream to consumers — that’s what “egress” is about.

Why code an egress?

Distribution to many consumers

Traders, algos, risk engines, dashboards all want the same stream.

You don’t want each consumer connecting directly to every venue feed ? wasteful and inconsistent.

Instead, you publish once from your aggregator, then egress layer fans it out efficiently.

Transport decoupling

Inside your aggregator, you might use channels or ring buffers (in-memory).

Outside, consumers may require:

Sockets (TCP/UDP, multicast)

WebSockets (browser dashboards)

Kafka, NATS, Redis Streams (persistence + pub/sub)

Shared memory / UDS (for colocated HFT processes)

The egress abstracts how the data leaves your process.

Access control & throttling

Some consumers may only be entitled to a subset (e.g. equities vs futures).

Some may need throttled feeds (e.g. 100ms snapshots vs tick-by-tick).

The egress layer enforces these policies without modifying core aggregation.

Resilience & backpressure

Consumers might be slow.

Egress can conflate, drop, or queue according to rules — protecting your aggregator from stalls.

Monitoring

The egress layer is also the natural place to measure:

How many clients?

What symbols subscribed?

Latency to last hop?

Bandwidth per client?

   WebSocket   Kafka    Shared Memory
   Clients     Cluster  Co-located algos
   
   
   
   So to answer your “why”:
   You code an egress because the aggregator alone is not useful until you serve the normalized data out. The egress is the last hop that transforms your in-process events into consumable feeds for the outside world, while handling performance, entitlement, and backpressure concerns.
   
   Do you want me to show you how to structure multiple egress backends (WebSocket + Kafka + shared memory) behind a single interface, so you can plug/unplug distribution methods without touching the aggregator core?

   là il me code un multiple egress, avec interface abstraite.
   
   
   Awesome — here’s a clean way to plug in multiple egress backends (WebSocket + Kafka + Named Pipes for local IPC) without touching the aggregator core.
   
   The pattern:
   
   Define a tiny IEgressPublisher interface.
   
   Implement one class per transport (WebSocket/Kafka/NamedPipe).
   
   Use a CompositeEgressPublisher to fan out to many backends.
   
   Each client gets its own bounded Channel to absorb bursts and apply a drop/conflation policy so slow clients don’t stall the whole system.
   
   Below are drop-in files you can add to the aggregator project I gave you.
   
   
   Why this design works well
   
   Decoupled: Aggregator publishes once; egress backends are pure subscribers.
   
   Backpressure-safe: Each client has a bounded queue. Slow clients don’t block others.
   
   Policy-driven: You can tweak capacity, drop strategy, and conflation without touching transports.
   
   Composable: Add/remove backends by editing the CompositeEgressPublisher list.
   
   Extensible: Implement IEgressPublisher for gRPC, NATS, Redis Streams, UDP multicast, UDS, etc.
   
   If you want, I can add symbol-level subscriptions per client (e.g., WebSocket client sends { "subscribe": ["AAPL"] }) and show how to filter in EgressHub with a concurrent topic map.
