each venue provides multi level feeed
you need to aggregate them 
the final aggregated feed should aggregate the feeds in a manner that for the same price, the size of different venues should be summed up

Got it — we’ll switch to multi-level (L2) aggregation where sizes at the same price across venues are summed, per side, and we’ll publish a consolidated depth (top-N). Below is a compact but production-style .NET 8 implementation you can run as-is.

It includes:

pluggable IMarketDataFeed emitting book deltas (price-level upserts)

per-venue order book state (bid/ask maps)

staleness filtering per venue

aggregation by price across venues (sizes summed)

stable top-N per side with change detection + min emit interval (conflation)
